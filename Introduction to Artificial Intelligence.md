## üß† Key Concepts and Topics

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. It enables computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as decision-making and language translation.

### Strong AI vs Weak AI
- **Strong AI**: Also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), it aims to replicate human cognitive abilities.
- **Weak AI**: Designed for specific tasks, like virtual assistants or recommendation systems.

### Predictive AI vs Generative AI
- **Predictive AI**: Analyzes historical data to forecast future outcomes.
- **Generative AI**: Creates new content such as text, images, or audio using models like GPT or DALL¬∑E.

### Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Modeled after the human brain, ANNs consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information using weights, biases, and activation functions.

### Pattern in Data
ML algorithms detect patterns or structures in data, such as trends or relationships, to make decisions or predictions.

### Robotics
AI-powered robots can perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
AI enhances IoT by enabling smart decision-making and automation across connected devices.

### Generative Systems
AI systems that generate new data or content‚Äîtext, images, music‚Äîbased on training data (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney).

### Labeled vs Unlabeled Data
- **Labeled data**: Annotated with correct output.
- **Unlabeled data**: No annotations; used in unsupervised or self-supervised learning.

### Massive Datasets
Large datasets are essential for training robust AI models, especially in deep learning and generative AI.

### Data Models
Mathematical representations of relationships in data used by AI to make predictions or decisions.

### Classify vs Cluster Data
- **Classification**: Assigns predefined labels to data.
- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points without predefined labels.

### Reinforcement Learning
An AI agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment.

### Common ML Algorithms
- **k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classifies data points based on the majority label of nearest neighbors.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into k number of clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Regression**: Predicts a continuous value (e.g., housing prices).
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem.

### Fit the Algorithm
Refers to training a model by adjusting it to best match the data.

### Overfitting vs Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model learns noise and performs poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying pattern.

### Building a Neural Network
Includes setting **weights**, **biases**, and choosing **activation functions** (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid) to control signal flow.

### Self-Supervised Learning
Models learn patterns from unlabeled data by solving pretext tasks (e.g., predicting missing parts of input).

### Foundation Models
Large, general-purpose models trained on diverse data that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks (e.g., GPT, BERT).

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
Foundation models trained on vast text corpora to understand and generate human-like text.

### Image Diffusion Models
Used in generative AI to create realistic images by gradually refining random noise into meaningful visuals.

### GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
Consists of two neural networks (generator and discriminator) that compete to produce increasingly realistic synthetic data.

### VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
A type of neural network that learns efficient, lower-dimensional representations of data for generation and reconstruction.

### Transformers (2017)
A neural network architecture introduced in 2017 that relies on self-attention mechanisms, powering models like BERT and GPT.

### Ethical and Legal Challenges
AI raises concerns about privacy, bias, fairness, accountability, and intellectual property. These must be addressed for responsible use.

### Applying AI to Solve Problems
Involves identifying appropriate use cases, preparing data, selecting the right model, and evaluating impact and performance.
